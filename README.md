# Artificial General Intelligence Story : The Stamp Collector

## Description

This is a short story (~15 min read) about artificial general intelligence (firstly an english homework).

## References 

This story is inspired by the thought experiment of the stamp collector, originally presented by [Robert Miles](https://twitter.com/robertskmiles), a PhD Student at the University of Nottingham, who does researches studies on AI safety.
This thought experiment was therefore not made by me, I just transformed it to make a story about it.

You can find Robert Miles talking about it in this link : [Deadly Truth of General AI? - Computerphile](https://youtu.be/tcdVC4e6EV4).
